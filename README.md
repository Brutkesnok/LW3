# Laboratory work 3. Statistics analyzer

A project was created to display statistics in the form of a table and graphs.
In the process of creation, a general graphical interface was created. Then an
interface was added so that specific classes could be inherited from it to read
information from a file, validate this information, and so on.

**Variant 9** (Kiselev A. == Brutkesnok):

> The user opens a file with data on prices in the primary housing market in
> Russia over the past 15 years. Display this information on the screen in a
> convenient format. Also use this data to make graphs. Calculate which
> n-bedroom apartments have increased in price the most.
